    I graduated from Manipal institute of technology in 2011 with a B.E. in Mechatronics. Immediately after, I worked at Accenture for 1.5 years. There I had an opportunity to work on various CRM applications and provide 3rd level technical support
    which included maintaining the application in the production environment and troubleshooting on failure.<br /><br />

    While working at Accenture, I had a chance encounter that allowed me to follow my passion for music. This led me to study music performance at Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music for 2 years.
    <br /><br>
    I have been working as a performing artist for the last 5 years and as a music instructor for 2 years. This has included touring and performing all over the India.
    I have worked in the studio to record songs, albums and jingles.<br /><br />

    I own a small music school, Thematic School of Music and Arts, where I teach students of varying age groups how to play guitar and keyboard, using a curriculum I have developed.
    <br><br>
    Over the years, I have programmed in languages such as VB6, C++, HTML, CSS and JAVA as a hobby.
    <br> <br>
    Currently, I am in the midst of undergoing training, through Udemy ( course by Tim Buchalka), on JAVA 11. My goal is to reacquaint myself with fundamental computer science concepts such as OOPS, programming paradigms
    (procedural/functional), algorithms, data structures.
